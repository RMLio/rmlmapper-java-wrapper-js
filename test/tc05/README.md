The file `functions_all.nt` contains all functions needed as `fno` parameter for the javascript wrapper.
This file was created by combining all the functions of the `fno-descriptions` directory,
needed because if we add our own function description we also have to provide the default ones.

The folder `foo-function` contains the java source of the dummy function used for testing.
